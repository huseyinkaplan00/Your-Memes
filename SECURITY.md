## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our users and our systems by reporting vulnerabilities to us.

Here's how:

- Please e-mail the lead maintainer at kaplanhuseyin1999@gmail.com with as many details as possible about the vulnerability.
- Your report will be acknowledged within 2-3 business days, and youâ€™ll receive a more detailed response to your email within a week about the next steps in fixing the issue.
- If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few weeks.

Thank you for improving the security of memeGenerator. We appreciate your effort to make our project safer, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
